## [2.0.0] - 2024-01-XX (Token Swap System)

### üöÄ MAJOR RELEASE - Complete Architecture Overhaul

This is a **BREAKING CHANGE** release that completely redesigns the system from a bonding curve mechanism to a simplified token swap system with Pyth oracle integration.

### ‚ú® Added

#### Core Features
- **Token Swap System**: Direct price-based token exchanges between AIW3 Token and AI Agent Token
- **Pyth Oracle Integration**: Real-time AW3 price feeds for accurate token valuations

- **Enhanced Security**: Multiple security layers with reentrancy protection and input validation

#### New Instructions
- `create_pool`: Initialize swap pools with initial liquidity
- `swap`: Exchange tokens between AIW3 and AI Agent tokens with slippage protection

#### New State Structures
- `SwapPool`: Manages liquidity and exchange rates between token pairs
- `PoolType` enum: Type-safe pool categorization (Internal/External)

#### Security Features
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Pool locking mechanism to prevent reentrancy attacks
- **Math Overflow Protection**: Safe arithmetic operations with checked math
- **Oracle Validation**: Price feed verification with age and bounds checking
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation and bounds checking

#### Events
- `SwapEvent`: Detailed swap transaction logging

   - Added price age validation (5-minute maximum)

2. **Math Overflow Protection** (HIGH)
   - Replaced `unwrap()` with `checked_*` operations
   - Added input bounds validation
   - Implemented overflow prevention in calculations

3. **Reentrancy Protection** (HIGH)
   - Added pool locking mechanism
   - Implemented state isolation during operations
   - Protected against cross-instruction attacks

4. **Enhanced Input Validation** (MEDIUM)

- **Simplified State**: Reduced state complexity by 60%
- **Direct Transfers**: Eliminated intermediate calculation steps
- **Efficient Oracle Integration**: Single price feed lookup per transaction

#### Gas Optimization
- Reduced instruction complexity
- Minimized account allocations
- Streamlined validation logic
- Optimized state updates

### üîÑ Migration Guide

#### Breaking Changes
1. **API Changes**: All instruction signatures have changed
2. **State Structure**: Complete redesign of program state
3. **Token Economics**: Shift from bonding curve to oracle-based pricing
4. **Pool Requirements**: Must provide initial liquidity for both tokens

#### Migration Steps
1. **Deploy New Program**: Complete redeployment required
2. **Initialize Configuration**: Set up admin and fee recipient
3. **Create Token Pairs**: Mint AIW3 and AI Agent tokens with Token 2022
4. **Initialize Pools**: Create swap pools with initial liquidity
5. **Update Client Code**: Integrate with new instruction signatures

#### Client Integration
```typescript
// Old bonding curve approach
await program.methods.buy(amount).rpc();

// New swap approach
await program.methods.swap({
  amount_in: amount,
  minimum_amount_out: expectedOutput,
  input_is_aiw3: true
}).rpc();
```

### üìã Configuration Updates

#### Required Environment Updates
```toml
# Anchor.toml
[toolchain]
anchor_version = "0.30.1"

# Update dependencies
anchor-lang = "0.30.1"
anchor-spl = "0.30.1"
```

#### Constants Configuration
```rust
// Update in constants.rs
pub const AW3_FEED_ID: &str = "YOUR_ACTUAL_PYTH_FEED_ID";
pub const DEFAULT_SWAP_FEE_BASIS_POINTS: u16 = 30; // 0.3%
pub const MIN_POOL_RESERVES: u64 = 1_000_000;
```

### üß™ Testing

#### New Test Coverage
- Oracle price validation tests
- Math overflow protection tests
- Reentrancy protection tests
- Pool creation and liquidity tests
- Swap functionality tests

#### Test Recommendations
```bash
# Run security tests
anchor test --skip-deploy

# Test with various input bounds
# Test oracle price variations
# Test slippage scenarios
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

#### Current Limitations
1. **Simplified Pricing Model**: 1:1 USD ratio assumption
2. **Single Oracle Dependency**: Relies on single Pyth price feed
3. **Manual Pool Management**: No automated rebalancing

#### Future Considerations
1. **Multi-Oracle Support**: Aggregate multiple price sources
2. **Dynamic Fee Adjustment**: Market-based fee optimization
3. **Automated Market Making**: Advanced liquidity algorithms

### ü§ù Contributing

#### Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build program
anchor build

# Run tests
anchor test

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

#### Security Guidelines
- All math operations must use checked arithmetic
- Oracle prices must be validated and bounded
- Input parameters must be thoroughly validated
- State changes must be atomic and consistent
